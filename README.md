# EduPro Online Learning Platform Analysis

## 1. Introduction

This project is created using Power BI to analyze data from the EduPro Online Learning Platform. The main purpose of this project is to understand learner behavior, course enrollment patterns, and preferences based on age, gender, and course level. The insights from this analysis can help the platform improve course planning and learner engagement.

## 2. Objectives of the Project

The key objectives of this project are:

* To analyze the age distribution of learners on EduPro
* To study how course enrollment varies across different age groups
* To identify gender-based differences in course selection
* To find the most popular course categories
* To understand beginner preferences in course levels and types

## 3. Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains information related to learners and their course enrollments. The main fields used are:

* Learner ID
* Age / Age Group
* Gender
* Course Category
* Course Level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
* Enrollment ID

The data was provided in Excel format and loaded into Power BI for analysis.

## 4. Tools and Technologies Used

* Power BI Desktop
* Microsoft Excel
* Power Query (for data cleaning)

## 5. Data Cleaning and Preparation

Before creating the dashboard, basic data cleaning was performed using Power Query:

* Removed blank and incorrect values
* Checked data types for age and enrollment fields
* Ensured consistency in gender and course category names

After cleaning, the data was ready for visualization.

## 6. Dashboard Design

The Power BI report is designed using only **two pages** to keep it simple and easy to understand.

### Page 1: Learner Demographics and Enrollment Overview

This page focuses on learner details and enrollment patterns.

Visuals included:

* Card showing total number of learners
* Column chart showing age distribution of learners
* Stacked column chart showing course enrollment by age group
* Clustered bar chart showing gender-based course selection
* Slicers for age group and gender

This page helps in understanding who the learners are and how different age groups and genders choose courses.

### Page 2: Course Popularity and Beginner Preferences

This page focuses on course performance and beginner behavior.

Visuals included:

* Bar chart showing most popular course categories
* Donut chart showing distribution of course levels
* Stacked column chart showing beginner course preferences
* Slicer for course category

This page helps identify which courses are most in demand and what beginners prefer to learn.


## 7. Key Insights

* Most learners belong to specific age groups, showing clear age-based trends
* Certain course categories have higher enrollments compared to others
* Beginner-level courses attract the highest number of enrollments
* Course preferences vary slightly based on gender

## 8. Conclusion

This Power BI project successfully analyzes learner and course data from the EduPro platform. The dashboard answers all key analytical questions in a simple and interactive way. The insights from this report can help EduPro improve course offerings and target learners more effectively.

## 9. Future Scope

* Add time-based analysis to track enrollment trends
* Include course completion and performance data
* Create separate dashboards for instructors and management
